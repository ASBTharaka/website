<h1 ><strong>Gastrointestinal Diseases</strong></h1><br>
</div>

<strong><h2>What are gastrointestinal diseases?</h2></strong><br>
<p>Gastrointestinal diseases affect your <a href="introduction.html">gastrointestinal (GI) tract</a> , from mouth to anus. There are two types: functional and structural. Some examples include colitis, food poisoning, lactose intolerance and diarrhea.</p><br>

<strong><h2>What are functional gastrointestinal diseases?</h2></strong><br>
<p>Functional diseases are those in which the GI tract looks normal when examined, but doesn't move properly. They are the most common problems affecting the GI tract (including your colon and rectum). Constipation, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), nausea, gas, bloating and diarrhea are common examples.</p><br>
<p>Many factors can upset your GI tract and its motility (ability to keep moving), including:</p><br>
 <ol>
    <li>Eating a diet low in fiber.</li>
    <li>Not getting enough exercise.</li>
    <li>Traveling or other changes in routine.</li>
    <li>Eating large amounts of dairy products.</li>
        Stress.
    <li>Resisting the urge to have a bowel movement, possibly because of hemorrhoids.</li>
    <li>Overusing anti-diarrheal medications that, over time, weaken the bowel muscle movements called motility.</li>
    <li>Taking antacid medicines containing calcium or aluminum.</li>
    <li>Taking certain medicines (especially antidepressants, iron pills and strong pain medicines such as narcotics).</li>
    <li>Pregnancy.</li>
    </ol><br>
    <p>Some people also have heightened sensitivity in the organs of their GI tract (visceral hypersensitivity). This can make them feel pain or discomfort even when the organs are functioning normally.</p><br>

    <strong><h2>What are structural gastrointestinal diseases?</h2></strong><br>
    <p>Structural gastrointestinal diseases are those where your bowel looks abnormal upon examination and also doesn't work properly. Sometimes, the structural abnormality needs to be removed surgically. Common examples of structural GI diseases include strictures, stenosis, hemorrhoids, diverticular disease, colon polyps, colon cancer and inflammatory bowel disease.</p><br>

    <strong><h2>What are some of the common gastrointestinal diseases that healthcare providers treat?</h2></strong><br>
    <p>Healthcare providers who specialize in gastrointestinal diseases are called gastroenterologists. Surgeons who specialize in gastrointestinal diseases are called colorectal surgeons (proctologists). Some of the most common conditions they treat include:</p><br>

    <!--constipation-->

    <strong><i><u>Constipation</u></i></strong>
    
    <br><br><p>Constipation, which is a functional problem, makes it hard for you to have a bowel movement (or pass stools), the stools are infrequent (less than three times a week), or incomplete. Constipation is often related to inadequate "roughage" or fiber in your diet, or a disruption of your regular routine or diet.

        Constipation causes you to strain during a bowel movement. It may cause small, hard stools and sometimes anal problems such as fissures or hemorrhoids. Constipation is rarely the sign that you have a more serious medical condition.<br>
        
        You can treat your constipation at home by</p><br>
    <ol style="list-style-type:square">
        <li>Increasing the amount of fiber and water to your diet.</li>
        <li>Exercising regularly and increasing the intensity of your exercises as tolerated.</li> 
        <li>Moving your bowels when you have the urge (resisting the urge causes constipation).</li>
    </ol><br>
    <p>If these treatment methods don't work, laxatives can be useful. Always follow the instructions on your laxative medicine, as well as the advice of your healthcare provider</p><br>


    <!--Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-->

    <strong><i><u>Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)</u></i></strong><br><br>

    <p>Irritable bowel syndrome (also called spastic colon, irritable colon, IBS, or nervous stomach) is a functional condition where your intestinal muscles contract more or less often than “normal.” Certain foods, medicines and emotional stress are some factors that can trigger IBS.<br>

        Symptoms of IBS include:</p>

        <ol style="list-style-type:square">
             <li>Abdominal pain and cramps.</li>
             <li>   Excess gas.</li>
             <li> Bloating.</li>
             <li> Change in bowel habits such as harder, looser, or more urgent stools than normal.</li>
             <li>Constipation and/or diarrhea</li><br>
        </ol>
        <p>You can treat IBS at home by:</p><br>

        <ol style="list-style-type:square">
            <li>Avoiding excessive caffeine.
            <li>   Increasing fiber in your diet.</li>
             <li>   Monitoring which foods trigger your IBS (and avoiding these foods).</li>
             <li>  Minimizing stress or learning different ways to cope with stress.</li>
             <li> Taking medicines as prescribed by your healthcare provider.</li>
             <li> Avoiding dehydration, and hydrating well throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Getting high quality rest/sleep.</li>
        </ol>

       <br>
        <!--Gastritis-->
        <strong><i><u>Gastritis</u></i></strong><br><br>
        <p>Gastritis is a general term for a group of conditions with one thing in common: Inflammation of the lining of the stomach. The inflammation of gastritis is most often the result of infection with the same bacterium that causes most stomach ulcers or the regular use of certain pain relievers. Drinking too much alcohol also can contribute to gastritis.

            Gastritis may occur suddenly (acute gastritis) or appear slowly over time (chronic gastritis). In some cases, gastritis can lead to ulcers and an increased risk of stomach cancer. For most people, however, gastritis isn't serious and improves quickly with treatment.<br>
            Gastritis doesn't always cause symptoms. When it does, the symptoms of gastritis may include:<br><br>
        
        </p>
        <ol style ="list-style-type: square">
            <li>Gnawing or burning ache or pain, called indigestion, in your upper belly. This feeling may become either worse or better after eating.</li>
            <li>Nausea.</li> 
            <li>Vomiting.</li> 
            <li>A feeling of fullness in your upper abdomen after eating.</li><br><br>
             
        </ol>

        <!--Diarrhea-->
        <strong><i><u>Diarrhea</u></i></strong><br><br>
        <p>Diarrhea means having a loose or watery stool (poop). It’s so common that most people flinch when they hear the word. The thought of thin, sickly-looking poop in the toilet bowl never stops feeling unpleasant. If you have diarrhea, not knowing what’s causing it or how long it’ll last only adds stress to the unpleasant feelings.<br>

        <br> The good news is that diarrhea is usually mild (only a few bathroom trips a day) and goes away within a few days.<br>
            
        <br>Sometimes, though, diarrhea is a sign of a serious condition. It can cause you to lose too much fluid (dehydration) or prevent you from getting enough nutrients. It’s important to know what to look out for so you know when to see a healthcare provider about diarrhea and when to wait it out.<br><br>

        Diarrhea goes by different names depending on how long it lasts:</p><br>
        <ol style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>Acute diarrhea: Acute diarrhea is loose, watery diarrhea that lasts one to two days. It’s the most common type and usually goes away without treatment.</li><br>
            <li>   Persistent diarrhea: Persistent diarrhea lasts about two to four weeks.</li><br>
            <li>   Chronic diarrhea: Chronic diarrhea lasts more than four weeks or comes and goes regularly over a long period. Diarrhea that lasts this long may indicate a more serious condition that warrants a visit with your healthcare provider.</li><br><br>
        </ol>
        <p>The main sign of diarrhea is loose or watery stool. Other common symptoms include:<br><br>
         <ol style="list-style-type: square">
            <li>Bloating or cramps in your belly.</li><br>
            <li> A strong and urgent need to poop.</li><br>
            <li> Nausea (upset stomach).</li><br>
        </ol></p>
        
        <p>These symptoms usually don’t require a provider visit, especially if they only last a few days.</p><br>

        <!--Nausea & Vomiting-->
        <strong><i><u>Nausea & Vomiting</u></i></strong><br><br>
        <p>You know the feeling. Maybe you ate something your stomach didn’t agree with. Or perhaps you’re going through cancer treatments. It could be one of the first signs that you’re pregnant. That distinct “sick to your stomach,” queasy feeling is a familiar one. Nausea is an uncomfortable feeling in the back of your throat or an uneasiness in your stomach. You may also feel dizzy, lightheaded or have difficulty swallowing. Nausea often goes along with the urge to vomit but doesn’t always lead to vomiting. Vomiting is the forcible emptying (“throwing up”) of stomach contents through your mouth. When you vomit, your stomach muscles squeeze together (contract), propelling your stomach’s contents up through your esophagus and out your mouth. Nausea and vomiting aren’t diseases but rather are symptoms of many different conditions, such as:</p><br>

        <ol style="list-style-type: square">
            <li>Infections like “stomach flu” (gastroenteritis).</li>
            <li>Food poisoning.</li>
            <li>Motion sickness.</li>
            <li>Pregnancy.</li>
            <li>Migraines (headache nausea).</li>
        </ol>
        <br><p>Changes in your immune system and central nervous system can trigger your nausea and vomiting reflexes. Many different things can cause these changes. Some common nausea causes include:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: square">
            <br><li>Gastrointestinal (GI) conditions like peptic ulcers, gastritis and gastroparesis.</li>
            <li> Seasickness and other motion sicknesses.</li>
            <li>Early pregnancy.</li>
            <li> Intense pain.</li>
            <li>Food poisoning.</li>
            <li>Indigestion (nausea after eating).</li>
            <li>Infections.</li>
            <li> Migraine headaches.</li>
            <li> Vertigo.</li>
            <li>Certain smells or odors.</li>
            <li> Overindulgence of alcohol or marijuana.</li>
            <li>Medications (for example, as a side effect of chemotherapy).</li><br>
        </ol>
        <p>Usually, vomiting is harmless, but it can be a sign of a more serious illness. Some examples of serious conditions that may bring on nausea or vomiting include:</p><br>

        <ol style="list-style-type: square">
            <li>Concussions.</li>
            <li>Encephalitis.</li>
            <li>Meningitis.</li>
            <li>Intestinal blockage.</li>
            <li> Appendicitis.</li>
            <li>Brain tumors.</li><br>
        </ol>

        <!--Anal fissures-->
        <strong><i><u>Anal fissures</u></i></strong><br><br>
        <p>Anal fissures are also a structural disease. They are splits or cracks in the lining of your anus. The most common cause of an anal fissure is the passage of very hard or watery stools. The crack in the anal lining exposes the underlying muscles that control the passage of stool through the anus and out of the body. An anal fissure is one of the most painful problems your can have, because the exposed muscles become irritated from exposure to stool or air. This leads to intense burning pain, bleeding, or spasms after bowel movements.

            Initial treatment for anal fissures includes pain medicine, dietary fiber to reduce the occurrence of large, bulky stools and sitz baths (sitting in a few inches of warm water). If these treatments don't relieve your pain, surgery might be needed to repair the fissure.</p>

     <!--Colon polyps and cancer-->
     <strong><i><u>Colon polyps and cancer</u></i></strong><br><br>
     <p>Each year, 130,000 Americans are diagnosed with colorectal cancer, the second most common form of cancer in the United States. Fortunately, with advances in early detection and treatment, colorectal cancer is one of the most curable forms of the disease. By using a variety of screening tests, it is possible to prevent, detect and treat the disease long before symptoms appear.</p><br>

     <p class="colo"><strong> importance of colorectal cancer screening</strong></p><br>

     <p>Almost all colorectal cancers begin as colon polyps, benign (non-cancerous) growths in the tissues lining your colon and rectum. Cancer develops when these polyps grow and abnormal cells develop and start to invade surrounding tissue. Removal of polyps can prevent the development of colorectal cancer. Almost all precancerous polyps can be removed painlessly during a colonoscopy screening. If not caught in the early stages, colorectal cancer can spread throughout the body. More advanced cancer requires more complicated surgical techniques.<br>

        Most early forms of colorectal cancer do not cause symptoms, which makes screening especially important. When symptoms do occur, the cancer might already be quite advanced. Symptoms include blood on or mixed in with the stool, a change in normal bowel habits, narrowing of the stool, abdominal pain, weight loss, or constant tiredness.<br>
        
        Most cases of colorectal cancer are detected in one of four ways:<br><br>
        <ol style="list-style-type: square">
          <li>By screening people at average risk for colorectal cancer beginning at age 45.</li>
          <li> By screening people at higher risk for colorectal cancer (for example, those with a family history or a personal history of colon polyps or cancer).</li>
          <li>By investigating the bowel in patients with symptoms.</li>
          <li> A chance finding at a routine check-up.</li>
        </ol>
        Early detection is the best chance for a cure.</p>
